Abstract: Using a drug review dataset gathered from online pharmaceutical websites, machine learning methods are employed on numerical data to determine if patient ratings given for efficacy and side effects have a linear relationship with overall rating, and whether univariate and multivariate logistic regression can accurately predict whether a patient's overall rating of a prescription drug will be positive or negative. Preprocessing, tf-idf vectorizing, ridge classification, and data visualization are used to analyze whether text review fields can accurately predict a positive or negative patient review.
